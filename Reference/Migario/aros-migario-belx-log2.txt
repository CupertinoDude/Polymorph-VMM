* Tcheko_ has joined #aros
<NomadOfNorad> anyone have experience with choosing the best wifi-equiped router?  the one I have, other machines in the house keep losing their wifi connection to it.
<migario> in need of a littlebit of care and attention NomadOfNorad ? ;-p
<migario> ow
<migario> hehe
<NomadOfNorad> something like that, yeah
<migario> yah i just was a little late in my reply :slow:
* stefkos has joined #aros
<migario> NomadOfNorad: it is disaster here, because i live in an appertment building. signals get pushed away constantly :(
<NomadOfNorad> I have a Netgear draft-N wifi router, and I've been having issues with other wifi machines in the house spontaneously losing connection to it.  We recently were presented with a wifi-style iPad.... and that one (but not the other iPads my visiting relatives have) loses the wifi connection, too.  I'm wanting advice on choosing a better (brand of?) wifi-based router.  Probably NOT another Netgear.
<migario> i have a belkin, it dies the job for me (if possible). but i am not really familair with wifi-devices
<migario> dies=does
<migario> i take it you have checked the netgear forums as well as updated your firmware ?
<NomadOfNorad> Tried to check for firmware update last night.... it gave an error that it could not connect with the update-the-firmware server and to try again later.
<migario> doesn't netgear offer an offline solution ?
<migario> hehe thats sounds funny :-D
<NomadOfNorad> Went to their place manually to search for firmware.... and when I plugged in a search criteria on their search function, I got sent to a page saying their search function was temporarily down while they did some sort of update to their systems.  oO
<migario> how are you suppose to keep up to date ? uhmz, well try another day ? but eprhaps you can try if others have the same problem as well. if enough trouble mostly a solution follows :/
<migario> not really an answer to your original question, sorry
* Coder_Aros has quit IRC (Quit: When the chips are down, the buffalo is empty)
<NomadOfNorad> grrrrrr..... and my internet service is deciding to be terrible right now.  oO
<migario> in such cases i mostly cease my actions and try another day... some days are bad so i leave it that way :/
<migario> not worth the frustration

<Kalamatee> NomadOfNorad : a> don't relly on its inbuilt checks for firmware - go to netgears site and look yourself
<Kalamatee> b> when you say "lose connection" - please be a bit more descriptive. do the devices no longer see the SSID being broadcast/see it but can't connect?
* Geit has joined #aros
<Kalamatee> or perhaps they think they are still connected but no traffic is flowing?
<Kalamatee> anyhows first thing is try updating the firmware - see how that goes and if there are still issues, try changing the authentication used and see if the clients will play better with that.
<Kalamatee> NomadOfNorad : theres also the possiblity someone is trying to wardrive your connection and de-authenticating your clients to try and sniff the handshake
* Kalamatee shrugs
<NomadOfNorad> WEll, I wasn't the one doing the connect with the iPad.  And all the other iPads were working fine.  And now THAT iPad is working fine.  Go figure.
<Kalamatee> hehe
* stefkos has joined #aros
<terminills> sup
<Kalamatee> hi term
<terminills> hey kal 
<terminills> ipads suck ;)
<Kalamatee> indeed
<Kalamatee> anything apple sucks
<terminills> especially the fanbois lol
<Kalamatee> apple are the only company I know that can have two identical phones and one will connect to your email server while the other won't (with identical settings on both)
<Kalamatee> how the fuck they do it I don't know ;p
<terminills> you just don't understand... the iphone 5 designer just said average users just won't get it. rofl
<Kalamatee> only special (need) users will ;P
<terminills> ironically if the iphone is the most popular phone wouldn't that make iphone users the average user?
<Kalamatee> most popular my ass
<NomadOfNorad> WEll, I've been delibrating between iPad and Android tablets for some while, but strongly leaning towards Android.... but relatives came yesterday and GAVE Dad an iPad. heh
<Kalamatee> NomadOfNorad : go to chinistore.com - and get a decent anroid one for cheap there ;p
<terminills> well I was talking specific models kal
<Kalamatee> terminills : thats the problem I guess - iphone have one brand, android is split into all the different manufacturers of handsets (though its still technically all android..)
<terminills> and my point would be does that mean iPhone users do't get the iphone? 
<terminills> don't
<terminills> mind you I have an ipad and an android tablet
<Kalamatee> most of the iphone users I know have switched
<terminills> the android tablet is better
<terminills> for me
<Kalamatee> I own neither but have to configure both for customers and know which I would prefer to be sent to setup ;p
<terminills> my next phone is going to be w8
<Kalamatee> using a huawei u8850 (honor) atm
<Kalamatee> not too bad but it suffers some android 4.0.3 bugs
<Kalamatee> first is the email widget doesn't update to reflect the actual emails
<Kalamatee> so it will show you stuff from yesterday but if you go into the email client all the new stuff is there also
<Kalamatee> second is the dreaded black screen of death
<Kalamatee> the phones still alive but you don't receive calls - and can't get the interface to respond
<Kalamatee> (the backlight doesn't come on but you can see the content rendered, and the touchscreen and buttons do nothing, except the power button)
<Kalamatee> fun ;p
<Kalamatee> bah its the u8860 - not 8850
<terminills> lol
* stefkos has quit IRC (Quit: Client exiting)
<terminills> sounds like my crackberry
<terminills> emergency oh crap I broke my atrix phone
<Kalamatee> just wish someone would do a 4.0.4 or jellybean rom instead since the problems are fixed in those
<terminills> rofl informercials rock

<Belxjander> Not much 
<Belxjander> I am still getting nothing when I ask for help about GCC inline assembly strangeness 
<Belxjander> I also need to get linux dual booting on my sam flex as well 
<agr> hi
<agr> may I help you with GCC inline asm ?
* MaMos has joined #aros
<Belxjander> I need multiple inline assembly fragments used as C functions mixed with C functions 
* Coder_Aros has joined #aros
<Belxjander> Agr I am using an android phone and typing on it sucks 
<agr> ok, I don't know it, but you still may explain more
<Belxjander> I have polymorph library which I am writing 
<Belxjander> It is a generic emulation/virtual machine support library 
<Belxjander> I need help with plugin wrapping for it 
<Belxjander> As plugins are datatype libraries 
<Belxjander> The inline assembly is for the AmigaOS branch 
<Coder_Aros> Is there a remote desktop utility for Aros that will allow me to control my Aros machine from my laptop?
<agr> Belxjander: if you show me a concrete example. I may do something maybe
* Zevs_ has quit IRC (Quit: Zevs_)
<Belxjander> Agr if I was able to do that for what I want I would not need help
<Belxjander> I know assembly and C but need the GCC special handling of inline assembly explained 
<Belxjander> Right now the documentation makes no sense to me 
* Ball000_ is now known as Ball000
* Coder_Aros has quit IRC (Quit: OUCH!!!)
* stefkos has joined #aros
<agr> Belxjander: if you know normal asm (well, gas), it is pretty simple: for regs you need to prefix them with %% instead of %, args are prefixed with %. after the asm part, comes a ':' and the output args, ':' input args, ':' constaints.
<Belxjander> Normal?
<Belxjander> It's the bit after the assembly which confuses me
<agr> Belxjander: normal = writing a separate asm file, when you don't really need it inlined
<Belxjander> And where in the docs does it say % for arguments and %% for registers?
* tichy^work has quit IRC (*.net *.split)
<agr> found it by reading others code
* tichy^work has joined #aros
<Belxjander> Well at least you have that 
<agr> you want one ?
<Belxjander> What processor?
<agr> pc
<agr> well, knowing asm is required
<agr> http://wiki.osdev.org/Inline_Assembly/Examples

<Kalamatee> hi BSzili
<BSzili> hey!
<Kalamatee> hows things?
<BSzili> a bit slower than the usual rate, but I still managed to do a playable port of frogatto :P
<Kalamatee> hehe
<BSzili> BTW, if you don't plan to work on Doom3 in the near future, I'd love to find out what causes that darn crash
<Kalamatee> would be nice
<Kalamatee> my suspicion is that it is referencing a destroyed object
<BSzili> yeah. but it's interesting that it doesn't causes a segfault on linux, or windows
<Kalamatee> could be a driver issue but i don't know
<Kalamatee> I didn't investigate it too much - changing the code has wacky results sometimes lol
<Kalamatee> I could see where it crashed and what caused the crash (null pointer) - but no idea why
<Kalamatee> if memory serves me it was trying to transform the coordinates of a particle but used a null pointer during the transform causing the crash
<BSzili> maybe some sanity checks could serve as a workaround to the problem
<Kalamatee> tried that .. it didn't like it lol
<Kalamatee> doom3 has a habbit of breaking in wacky ways =)
<BSzili> did it still crash?
<Kalamatee> yup
<Kalamatee> or didn't even load
<BSzili> lol
<Kalamatee> BSzili : first thing to do is merge the dll code changes
<Kalamatee> BSzili : if you want I could chuck it on my google code site
<Kalamatee> + the shared sdl stuff
<BSzili> that would be nice. oh, how stable is the shared SDL library?
<Kalamatee> sdl.library itself works well
<Kalamatee> the support libraries though... thats the whole different ball game
<Kalamatee> you could link to them statically still if necessary - but they depend on too much external stuff that all uses their own globals
<Kalamatee> = a nightmare to clean up
<BSzili> :-\
<Kalamatee> BSzili : any of the sdl libs that need to link in external stuff will be an effort to sanitise to work properly as a shared library
<Kalamatee> im open to offers of help ;p
* Cammy has joined #aros
* guest__ has joined #aros
<BSzili> I'm still pretty illiterate on how shared libraries work :S
<Kalamatee> not much to them
<Kalamatee> BSzili : the problem is we need to use "per-task" libraries so that the contents of library structures are unique between tasks
<BSzili> oh, so globals are no good...
<Kalamatee> linking to external code using globals means task a calls lib function -> goes into support code and uses some global
<Kalamatee> task b calls the function -> goes into support code which references the same/wrong pointers from task a
<Kalamatee> -> things get upset
<BSzili> so if the other libraries SDL depends on were shared too, then there weren't a problem
<Kalamatee> yes
<Kalamatee> but thats the bit which is a lot of work
<Kalamatee> and strictly speaking you shouldn't use other libraries from within a library
<Kalamatee> *unless you open and close it yourself
<BSzili> but weren't some static libraries already reworked into shared ones?  at least I saw a few for ABIv1
<Kalamatee> http://code.google.com/p/kalamateesarosextras/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fcontrib%2FSDL
* eliotmc has quit IRC (Quit: eliotmc)
<Kalamatee> if you want to modify any of the code - copy the extracted directory from under bin/<arch>/Ports into the source directory and modify the files as necessary - then call the create patch macro in the mmakefile.src
<Kalamatee> reneme the newly generated patch and delete the directory you copied in
<Kalamatee> btw - yes, the thread stuff is broken in AROS
<Kalamatee> ive fixed it a bit in my shared implementation - you can run the tests though and see whats broken and why ;)
<BSzili> oh, that one sounds a good candidate to backport :P I can finally finish my homeworld port
<Kalamatee> i would be grateful if you could try it with just the shared sdl.library (and statically linked versions of sdl_xxx)
<Kalamatee> the main code should be totaly thread/task safe
<BSzili> if that works, then I'll be glad to try that
<Kalamatee> like i said - its just the support libs that cause issues
* arsdmthe has joined #aros
<BSzili> what about the shared jpeg and png libraries? do they use any features specific to  ABIv1?
<Kalamatee> probably
<Kalamatee> no idea though
<BSzili> darn. because I don't think SDL_image depends on anything else

<BSzili> Kalamatee: will I be able to build this thing if I only replace SDL_main?
<Kalamatee> you might need to modify the target names in the other libs mmakefiles
<Kalamatee> but otherwise yes

<Ball000> migario : hi! :-) ... about the screenshot?
<migario> yups. i made a _big_ boo-boo
<migario> hi also :-)
<Ball000> you want me to try and delete it?
<migario> if you can then pleae do. i've uploaded the correct one right now
<Ball000> ok I'll have a look
<migario> thank you in advance

<Ball000> ;-) looks better now?
<migario> ahh, my hero.. :-)
<migario> thank you very much Ball000. this way it saves me from openly asking on the forums about solving my clumsyness :-D
<Ball000> no problemo ;-)
<migario> oh, nice you did the pending uploads as well :thumbsup:
<migario> Manu_aros: is it ok fro me to upload the rtcw kitty boxshot picture you created to the archives ?
<Manu_aros> Hi migario, Sure no problem :-)
<Manu_aros> I should have painted it but time is not enough :(
<Manu_aros> I mean colored it
<migario> ah ok. thanks. i was in the process of getting some screenshots for BSzili games and your picture was one of them ;-)
<migario> ah, don't worry. i think it is very nce as it is. but i know an artist is never done ;-)
<Manu_aros> That's actually true ;-)
<migario> yes, i know :-D
<migario> very frustrating sometimes to argue with artists, if you need a picture or a mod in time to meet a deadline :/
<migario> no offense ofcourse, i understand why
<Manu_aros> Yes inspiration usually never arises when you need it. But on a slow day at work when I have no chance of drawing I typically get lots of inspiration :-P

<Zevs_> j-uae is dead slow, I'm sorry to say
<BSzili> yeah, it's based on E-UAE

<Thordasin> sorry, i ment is ther an irc channel for developers?
<Ba11ooo_> developers come and chat here on #aros usually
<Ba11ooo_> there is no other official room
<Thordasin> oh :) i'm trying to compile aros for darwin but i'm haveing no luck any ideas where i can look for better instructions?
<Ba11ooo_> did you follow those instructions there: http://aros.sourceforge.net/documentation/developers/compiling.php ?
<Thordasin> i don't think so, i'll look at thos, i followed the instructions on the git under arch/all-darwin
* crazyhair has joined #aros
<Ba11ooo_> I would guess you miss some depandancies... Though I don't know what errors you encountered... And I don't build for darwin myself

<Ba11ooo> Salut olivier2222 !
<olivier2222> salut salut :)
* impy has joined #aros
<olivier2222> is AmiFIG on the repository?
<olivier2222> i can't find it
<Ba11ooo> http://archives.aros-exec.org/index.php?function=showfile&file=graphics/vector/amifig-suite_v0.8.zip ?
<olivier2222> that's the "suite", that is, the binary distro.
<olivier2222> it seems there are no other sources than sf://amifig
<olivier2222> through svn
<Ba11ooo> ok can't tell indeed
<olivier2222> on my build, amifig does compile & run.
<olivier2222> (AmiFIG v0.9, aros-i386 V1)
<Ba11ooo> :-)
<olivier2222> is there a way to fetch sources directly from svn with the aros build system?
<Ba11ooo> I'd guess that's more or less what is done in ports
<Ba11ooo> https://svn.aros.org/svn/aros/trunk/ports/text/polyglotman/mmakefile.src has " REPOSITORIES := sf://polyglotman"
<olivier2222> yeah, is looking for a _file_ named rman-3.2.tar.gz
<olivier2222> not for the svn in itself.
<olivier2222> thus, i subscribed to the amifig project, on sf.n
<olivier2222> seems its maintened by a french
<olivier2222> yannick erb
<olivier2222> ideally, i want to make a tarball of the 0.9 sources. i already have the necessary file tree for ports/amifig, mmakefile.src, etc.
<olivier2222> i have a problem here.
<olivier2222> a linux "sed" command problem... 
<olivier2222> in config/make.tmpl
<olivier2222> at copy_recursively
<olivier2222> in the skins/ directories names there are "simple quote" that breaks the build
<olivier2222> like: "Manu's Theme"
<olivier2222> (same in the aminet amifig-suite tree)
<Ba11ooo> o1i is the sed's guru... unfortunately he left one hour ago
* Bl1tter has joined #aros
<Ba11ooo> there is also https://svn.aros.org/svn/aros/trunk/ports/devel/ctags/mmakefile.src ... is it more useful?
<olivier2222> the command is "%copy_dir_recursive" actually
<olivier2222> tar.gz again, see in the %fetch_and_build line
<olivier2222> another thing is that AmiFIG is actually AROS focused.
<Ba11ooo> ok I wondered if this line _needed_ it or _built_ it
<olivier2222> it's a wget or something
<olivier2222> then again, having an amifig built with the build system returns many cpu/arch supported at once. works v1, about 5/10 lines to edit to compile it for aros.

<nikaros> mschulz: memory protection and all the mothern stuff.
<mschulz> forget
<mschulz> ;)
<nikaros> mschulz: Is there realy much point doing more for the classic AROS version.
<nikaros> mschulz: sure would break everything.
<nikaros> mschulz: But sometime it should happen, or is it just a bad idea.
<mschulz> I would love to see it happen :)
<nikaros> mschulz: that is the spirit :)
<nikaros> mschulz: many are so much against it.
<nikaros> mschulz: I just don't see how it could be a bad thing.
<nikaros> mschulz: We need to bring the ideas behind AmigaOS to 2012
<nikaros> mschulz: but introduse all the mothern stuff.
<mschulz> lol
<impy> like spell checkers
<mschulz> but who are we?

<nikaros> Fab1: are you there ?
<nikaros> Fab1: as far as I know streaming does not work with the youtube links anymore ?
<nikaros> Fab1: Download works good, so thanx for the new script.
<nikaros> I need someone to do a update script for AspireOS.
<nikaros> for future updates.
<nikaros> Ball000_: maybe something for you ;)

<olivier2222> yes
<olivier2222> and a shell start without any arguments doesn't crash more

<migario> ahr: just in case, olivier is here ;)
<migario> agr also
<olivier2222> :)
<agr> hi, yes
<olivier2222> what did i do, again?
<migario> because i was so stupid last time i thought i mention it :/
<olivier2222> tell?
<agr> olivier2222: I asked migario about you when you wasn't
<migario> O-o
<olivier2222> i wasn't?
<agr> here
<migario> olivier2222: i mistaken your identity with ol1's 
<olivier2222> oh, ok
<agr> because I just wrote oli22
<migario> and i missed the 22 part
<olivier2222> that's ok. i perfectly see: you both don't want to talk with me. i see now
<migario> thats a funny way of loking at it :-)
<olivier2222> he
<agr> olivier2222: how's AmigFig ?
<olivier2222> well, i did dsome light work on it
<olivier2222> i was able to compile mkbitmap, but it is crashing right before the start
<agr> light = lumiÃ¨re ?
* Kalamatee has joined #aros
<olivier2222> light = lÃ©ger. cromme crÃªme dessert light
<agr> :)
<olivier2222> Kalamatee: hi!
<olivier2222> agr: let me make a screenshot
<agr> k
<agr> how do you make a screenshot ? is it a screenshot of qemu ?
<migario> agr: there is a screenshot program in aros as well
<agr> migario: what is it's name ?
<olivier2222> http://reziztanzia.free.fr/Aros/Images/aros-amifig-dir.png
<migario> agr: good question, i have no idea (would have to look it up)
<olivier2222> agr: sys:tools/screengrabber
<migario> olivier2222: ah yes that one :-)
<agr> thank you
<olivier2222> this shot is done with ksnapshot
<agr> on aros hosted ?
<olivier2222> linux
<olivier2222> yes
<agr> ok
<agr> how did you port amifig ? with zune ?
<olivier2222> amifig: it isn't that stable, some features aren't working like fonts, colors, background color goes back to orange (i seen this before)
<olivier2222> i did not
<olivier2222> amifig exists for aros
<olivier2222> but notin the contrib
<olivier2222> the source is on sourceforge
<olivier2222> i did some mmakefiles, translation, file descriptors (for prefs, .fig, .fig-library), removed only one bug in the icon creation
<olivier2222> basically works on my i386-V1
<olivier2222> it isn"t using Zune. but Intuition.
<olivier2222> the export to bitmap does popup the lua script, with a zune window, then calls mkbitmap, but mkbitmap does crash there.
<olivier2222> exports and imports need some love.
<olivier2222> on the build side: there are simple quotes in filenames that break the build scripts. same for the space in the "potrace support" directory name
<olivier2222> i don't know how to handle thoses filenames
<olivier2222> using the build system, that is.
<agr> you tried to put \' in the mmakefile ?
<olivier2222> either than that, it could be packaged as a tar.gz on sourceforge, as and a fetch&build script could be used to biuld it.
<olivier2222> i will
<olivier2222> i wasn't able to link the other utils...
<olivier2222> maybe mazze will have more luck
<agr> there is a Makefile.aros in sf.net, did that worked some day ?
<olivier2222> can't tell, i don't use that method to build.

<migario> that looks cool olivier2222

<mschulz> Kalamatee: hi

<olivier2222> about, yes
<olivier2222> amifig => winfig you know...
<agr> cool, I can drop visio
<agr> xfig too
<olivier2222> :)
<agr> I was using xfig years ago but it was not very good
<olivier2222> yes
<olivier2222> amifig was and is better. and very simple. on aros it is missing some integration (datatypes), and some libraries of objects
<olivier2222> now, fig2dev is C++ mixed with C and i don't know how to link that.
<agr> you may have to port libstdc++, but I think someone is already using c++ in aros (mesa ?)
<olivier2222> yes some apps are using c++ and build for aros
<olivier2222> i mean, i don't know, with the build system, to create such an exe.
<agr> wpa_supplicant ? ask the guys who linked those ?

<olivier2222> well, it is mostly working in v1. i only had to add some includes here and there
<Ball000> hehe as I see it, it only needs Jason to complete his svg.datatype now ;-) and perhaps some endian macros here and there (colours)
<olivier2222> yes, many bugs are related to the way aros handle the arrays of constants
<olivier2222> if the svg datatype was working it would definately rox
<olivier2222> jason wanted the svg datatype for resizable icons

<migario> haiku is at the least a bit different
<holodeck> I found aros less buggy than haiku
<migario> hmz, i found haiku more stable (but i did not really use haiku, only testing)
<migario> although aros is very stable also lately
<migario> personally i did find haiku a little cold in it's appearance

<Belxjander2> goddammed disconnections 
<redblue> oh
<redblue> <Belxjander> Know about GCC register vars?
<redblue> im not even a newbie about that. just a wannabe ^^
<Belxjander2> I also need help decyphering register vars in GCC beyond the scope of a single function 
<redblue> but if i was u, id hang on c#, #c++ and #programming
<redblue> #c even
<Belxjander2> I only getting better "RTFM" comments from those channels 
<redblue> ignore em
<Belxjander2> I only get ...

<Belxjander2> I do and I waited for a different answer for two weeks 
<redblue> oh
* Fab has quit IRC (Quit: connection reset by Fab)
<Belxjander2> I need to declare register vars that are global and don't get fucked with 
<redblue> well there's #coders on ircnet, #coders on espernet, #coding on chatspike, #programming on swiftirc
<redblue> and #coders on efnet
<redblue> if u wanna give a try
<Belxjander2> Not while stuck with only android being online 
<redblue> k
<redblue> #osdev, #haiku, #reactos ?

<Belxjander2> Too easy to screw up descriptions and too many disconnection events while typing 
<redblue> hmm
<jahc> Belxjander2,  ahh..
<jahc> Belxjander2, unless you have a wifi adapter for the sam.. mimght be hard!!
<jahc> or impossible
<redblue> Belxjander2, and theres #vim, #emacs
<jahc> oh.. you could turn on wifi hotspot on your phone, connect laptop to phone, then connect sam to laptop via ethernet, bridge the laptops wifi and ethernet adapters
<jahc> thats pretty much how I got the Sam460 here connected to the internet 
<Belxjander2> Jahc I only have the sam and android 
<Belxjander2> There is nothing else here right now

<migario> register int foo asm ("r12");
<migario> register int *foo asm ("a5");
<Belxjander2> Migario only gives me errors 
<migario> anything specific ?
<Belxjander2> And I need them persistent across function calls 
<Belxjander2> I am making multiple threads and using the same entry point for all of them 
<migario> can't you store it in a var and use inline to push that value to the register you want ?
<migario> global register allocation is nearly impossible without rewriteing the compiler 
<migario> you cannot influence e.g. optimalization done by the compiler. it just uses the specific register regardless of what you tell the compiler to do. The longer the code the less likely 'your' register is not used for something by the compiler
<Belxjander2> No because the vars concerned exist multiple times with a single instance per process 
<migario> each and all in their own process space i assume ?
<Belxjander2> I need these vars to remain updated and in registers 
<Belxjander2> No  if but maybe or other options 
<Belxjander2> Each process is its own VM 
<Belxjander2> I am register remapping and have registers as registers 
<migario> than i am affraid i can't help any further on these specifics
<Belxjander2> And I am trying to do this with GCC for AmigaOS 4 and MorphOS and AROS 
<migario> yes i understand your situation, you've explained it before
<Belxjander2> Yes good 
* Kalamatee has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
<migario> and if i recall correctly i pointed you to context switching of the processor
<Belxjander2> Which dumps and restores all the registers on change of process 
<migario> correct
<Belxjander2> I am writing this as inside a single process where each thread is its own process 
<Belxjander2> I don't need fancy tricks for context changes 
<migario> then there is only one solution left
<migario> software context switching, but you don't want that if i recall correctly
<Belxjander2> I just need the context and register setup I make to persist for my process and have GCC behave 
<migario> but gcc can't behave...
<migario> so you need to do it manually
<Belxjander2> Once I setup this context it remains persistent for the life of that process 
* nighty^ has quit IRC (Read error: Operation timed out)
<Belxjander2> Using both the polymorph and plugin library code 
<migario> i understand that is your setup
<Belxjander2> I know How for SAS/C on 68k but I am not on that host for this 
<Belxjander2> I need this on AmigaOS GCC with PPC host 
<migario> congratulations... the days of sas/c, lattice and all those alike are long gone... the day a compiler let's you use and abuse the free registers it does not use itself is long gone. and afaik you cannot tell gcc to do that
<migario> but i am not familair with gcc
<migario> what i do know is that you use either a hardware context switch (if processor supports it) or you do it manually
<migario> hence why i called your implementation simulation instead of emulation
<migario> trust me when i tell that i wish there was a better solution for this
<migario> but there is none out of the box
<migario> btw: you wrote: Which dumps and restores all the registers on change of process 
<migario> which i replied correct
<migario> which is not entirely true
<migario> it is not always bound to change of process alone
<migario> intel procides a way to switch register context at your will
<migario> provides
<Belxjander2> bleh
<migario> yes i know, and i unfortunately know shite about ppc
<Belxjander2> well as long as I'm not needing to screw around too much
<migario> afaik it simply means you fill and store the registers you want and at your will
<migario> but it eats time 
<migario> see also here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k1a8ss06(v=vs.71).aspx
<migario> and here: http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Extended-Asm.html
<migario> and to stay with your solution (again i dont think it will work): http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Explicit-Reg-Vars.html#Explicit-Reg-Vars

<impy> deadwood_: great days at work i assume? :)
<Belxjander2> migario that kind of explains why I'm havingg troubles getting genuine help
<migario> probably no-one knows or won't tell... probably the latter. shame though, i am not an expert on these things
<migario> so what do i know :/
<migario> i understand your predicament perfectly. you want a good and fast (and maybe even easy) solution to the problem at hand. so you search for it, and ask if you don't know how to implement it practically. 
<migario> shame nobody explain things. like i said it's not my field at all, so i use wrong wordings, wrong examples and all that :/
<Belxjander2> more that I'm also unfamiliar with gcc
<migario> *shakes hand* :D
<Belxjander2> and the docs are limited to x86 
<migario> mostly yes
<migario> i've seen some arm floating around 
<Belxjander2> what I'm also in need of is a net linkage to my sam440
<Belxjander2> arm is different again
<Belxjander2> is there a qmake on AROS?
<migario> yes but for arm i know register bank switching is possible :-)
<migario> qmake, i have no idea. don't think so.
<Belxjander2> I'm using inline assembly blocks and need a fixed register layout
<migario> ow, that is cruel, webkit is cross-compiled with qmake :/
<migario> for your paramters you mean Belxjander2 ?
<Belxjander2> wanting openscad which needs qmake
<Belxjander2> yes
<Belxjander2> I'm not using registers in numeric order
<Belxjander2> and need vars to persist through recursion too
<migario> i understand your issue, but i have trouble finding a solution... these macros perhaps ?: http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Register-Arguments.html

* NomadOfNorad has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
<migario> hmz
<migario> perhaps a small light ?
<migario> -ffixed-reg
<migario> Treat the register named reg as a fixed register; generated code should never refer to it (except perhaps as a stack pointer, frame pointer or in some other fixed role). 
<migario> reg must be the name of a register. The register names accepted are machine-specific and are defined in the REGISTER_NAMES macro in the machine description macro file. 
<migario> This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a three-way choice.
<migario> from: http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.4.2/gcc/Code-Gen-Options.html#index-ffixed-1972
<Belxjander> you managed to find a description I didn't
<migario> craps, i just closed the stackoverflow question and answer that referred to it :/
<migario> wrong question, good answer #3 : :-) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2114163/reading-a-register-value-into-a-c-variable

<mschulz> have to made the quartal VAT report for tax office

<mschulz> besides I always plan to learn using it
<mschulz> and give up due to lack of time
<tichy> you don't want to do that ;)
